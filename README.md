moto

Moto is a fun iOS photo app which combines pictures from the front and the back camera to give you
a full view of whatsup. It lets you instantly share the picture on WeChat. I now know there is another popular
app called FrontBack that does this but there is a lot more that can be done (video hint hint)

It also supports localization (chinese) as I was trying to translate the app to use with a friend.
